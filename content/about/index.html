<h2 class="subtitle is-3 has-text-weight-normal">Why I do what I am doing</h2>

<div class="has-text-justified">
  <p>
  I started working with computers when I was around ten years old. In the beginning, I mainly used them for gaming, but got more and more interested in the internals --- how a computer actually works.
  </p>

  <p>
  In school, I started programming (Visual Basic and C#) and was completely blown away that I could TELL the computer what to do, whatever it was. I then began building my own computers, and after the German "Abitur" (comparable to a high school degree), I started studying Information and Communications Technology at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.
  </p>

  <p>
  During my university years, I first came in contact with Linux. It was like discovering computers all over again. With Linux, I was free to do everything I wanted with my computer. A few months after having my first contact with Linux, I abandoned Windows for good and have not looked back. I quickly learned everything I could about Linux and computer science in general. By choosing computer science courses over Electrical engineering courses (which I still like and do as a hobby) I decided on my career path: Information Technology.
  </p>

  <p>
  During my mandatory internship I worked at Tradebyte Software GmbH, a startup-become-medium-sized company offering SaaS solutions for eCommerce in Ansbach. After my internship, I stayed as a working student while finishing my master's thesis and started working full time right after graduation (ok, a one-month holiday in New Zealand was necessary!)

    I once read somewhere that you should have one hobby in each of the following three categories:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <b>physical hobby</b>, where you do some physical activity, preferably outside</li>
    <li>A <b>creative hobby</b>, where you create something new</li>
    <li>A hobby that makes you <b>money</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Well, the last one for me is the one that comes most naturally: I take care of my own
    private "cloud" that encompasses a few services that for me replace google, dropbox etc.
    I use this to keep up to date on a lot of technologies that I cannot work with in my
    day-to-day job. So it indirectly makes me money by increasing my market value.

        For a physical hobby, I do not have a single one or even one I focus one, but I do
        numerous different things. Quantity over quality if you want:

        The last kind of hobby&mdash;the creative one&mdash;is the one I have to force myself to do the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been learning the {{< myhighlight >}}Guitar{{< /myhighlight >}}
        since mid of 2019. I'm using <a href="https://www.justinguitar.com/">JustinGuitar's course</a> to get to
        know the basics. It's enough for some simple strumming, but don't expect any concerts right now.
        My goal is do be campfire-ready.

        When I was younger, I also took some piano lessions with my grandma. After a ten-year hiatus,
        I've been relearning the {{< myhighlight >}}Piano{{< /myhighlight >}}
        since beginning of 2020, after buying an electrical piano.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought a Yamaha P-45 (see picture). It has weighted keys and feels nearly like a "real" piano.

  <p>
    I also started attending a local church choir to work on my
    {{< myhighlight >}}Singing{{< /myhighlight >}}, but with the
    COVID-19 situation this is currently not possible. Maybe that's better for everyone,
    because no one has to listen to me singing. ;)

        During Corona, I got back into {{< myhighlight >}}Chess{{< /myhighlight >}}.
        My <a href="https://lichess.org/@/whatevsz">lichess rating</a> is currently around 1450.
        My goal is ~1550, which is around the 50th percentile / median, meaning I'd have a
        50/50 chance of beating a random opponent on lichess. Unfortunately, I'm mainly
        focussing on puzzles and not really playing longer games, mainly due to time contraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chess is both fascinating (due to the rules' simplicity) and frustrating
        (due to having no skill ceiling). It can be a grind to improve, but
        then one day you have this one game that makes it worth it.

    This webpage itself could also be considered a creative hobby.
    {{< myhighlight >}}Writing{{< /myhighlight >}} down technical
    stuff makes me internalize complex topics very efficiently.
